	<h2>Suggestions</h2>
	<p>Please let me know of any suggestions you may have for future versions.  On the current plan, I will be 
	updating for the next 10 weeks while adding a few more quotes as well as two main features.  
	After that, I plan on no longer supporting this plugin if there is no interest in it.  
	If you have any other features or concepts you would like added to this plugin, feel free to post on our 
	<a href="http://webdesign.vasculus.com/?page_id=43">Support Forums</a>.</p>
