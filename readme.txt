== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the drop in quotes in this version? =

Since I converted the plugin into using a table in the database and have added authors and categories, it takes a while to retype all those quotes.  Don't worry, I will have the plugin back up there by next update.

= Is there a way I can make the quote remain the same for some time and not change with every "click"? Is that possible? =

In this latest version, you are able to edit to set a timer for how long you want the quote to stay the same.

= What languages are you planning on supporting? =

I do not have a current plan on this subject, it is on a request basic; however, I am considering German, Italian, Spanish, French, English, Chinese, and Portuguese.

= I have an idea or I need help, how do I contact you? =
